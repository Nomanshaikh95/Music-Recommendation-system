# Music-Recommendation-system
Developed a recommendation system using collaborative filtering
techniques to recommend top 5 albums and top 5 similar albums
based on user-entered artist names. Utilized the Spotify API to
collect data on user preferences and developed a Python-based
model to provide personalized recommendations. The project
aimed to enhance user experience by providing relevant and
personalized music recommendations.
